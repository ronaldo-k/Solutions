	Storage:
	dp[n] stores the maximum sum of qualities from the pieces of cake are not
	eaten by Ginny.

	Recursion:
	dp[n] = max(The sequence of size K that ends in N is eaten:
				dp[i-k], or
				the sequence of size K that ends in N is not eaten:
				dp[i-1] + v[i])

	Bases:
	 - dp[0] = 0: It's impossible to eat any cake if there's no cake to be
	 eaten. Therefore, the quality stored in dp[0] must be equivalent to the
	 total sum of the qualities of zero cakes, that is, dp[0] = 0.
