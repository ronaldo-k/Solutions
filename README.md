# Solutions
 C++ solutions for diverse competitive programming problems

 This project is still under an organization process, as I'm not 100% sure of
 which codes actually work (There are definitely some with logic errors). For
 now, I'll be correcting the faulty files and uploading correct solutions, each
 tagged with the problem's name or ID number, the problem's source, the
 techniques used and a short explanation on how it works.
